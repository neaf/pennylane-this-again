Hello Pennylane people!

My first thought after reading the task description was the following:

The tool is so not critical that no one is going to endure any amount of friction. People want to sloppily type or dictate stuff and expect us to make it work. Hence I, opted for super simple input interface, even if that means sacrificing results "accuracy".

Using trigram similarity might match "olives" with "olive oil" or miss "rice" in "1 (8.5 ounce) package UNCLE BEN'S® Jasmine READY RICE®". However, assuming no recipe is going to exactly match the user's stock and people will mostly use the app for inspiration, I tried to select a treshold that strucks the right balance between input forgiveness and correctness of results.

It was a fun little challenge, even more so because I received it right after I promised my girlfriend to prepare a weekly meal plan, so we can avoid decision fatigue every other day. :)

I hope you enjoying playing with the solution.
